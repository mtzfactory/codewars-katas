# [Human Readable Time][human-readable-time-link]

Write a function, which takes a non-negative integer (seconds) as input and
returns the time in a human-readable format _(HH:MM:SS)_

- _HH_ = hours, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 99
- _MM_ = minutes, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
- _SS_ = seconds, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59

The maximum time never exceeds 359999 (_99:59:59_)
