# [Give Me A Diamond][give-me-a-diamond-link]

Jamie is a programmer, and James' girlfriend. She likes diamonds, and wants a
diamond string from James. Since James doesn't know how to make this happen, he
needs your help.

## Task

You need to return a string that looks like a diamond shape when printed on the
screen, using asterisk (\*) characters. Trailing spaces should be removed, and
every line must be terminated with a newline character (\n).

Return null/nil/None/... if the input is an even number or negative, as it is not
possible to print a diamond of even or negative size.

## Examples

A size 3 diamond:

```bash
 *
***
 *
```

...which would appear as a string of `" *\n***\n *\n"`

A size 5 diamond:

```bash
  *
 ***
*****
 ***
  *
```

...that is `"  *\n ***\n*****\n ***\n  *\n"`
